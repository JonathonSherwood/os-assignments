OVERVIEW:
This homework was to become familiar with the environment in hoare while
practicing system calls by implementing a logging utility based on a  template
in the UNIX Systems Programming.  We were assigned to create a library 
archive of the logging utility and show its use in a program that links this 
library (file "logtest.c" ).


Compile with the "make" utility. The main executable is name "logger" .
